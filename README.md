## Disclaimer

I have not personally tested this board. If you want to manufacture it, you should carefully go through the design once. Downloading this project and opening it in KiCad and running the ERC or DRC will result in many warnings, but almost all of them are safe to ignore as most of them are courtyard overlapping warnings.
